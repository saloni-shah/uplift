# uplift solution
  Implemented solution with two ways:
  getIn - usinng recursion
  getIn2 - using for loop
## getIn function which accepts object and keys in array form and returns the value depending on the key from object.
m = user object, 
ks = array of keys that need to find from user object, 
notFound = optional text
